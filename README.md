# Exercise Real-time Rendering WS 2015

More madness than magic will happen hear. Be prepared.

## Getting Started

Navigate into `cd project` and follow the next steps.

Create a build directory.

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run CMake from the build directory.

```
cmake ../
```

Hopefully CMake finishes without errors. Now you can use `make` to compile the program.

The program can be started by executing `source/source` from the build directory.
